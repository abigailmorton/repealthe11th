      <h2>Proposed Amendment</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Section 1.</strong> The Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed.</p>

        <p><strong>Section 2.</strong> Neither the United States nor any State shall be immune, by reason of sovereignty, from suit in any court of the United States arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, or treaties made under their authority.</p>

        <p><strong>Section 3.</strong> Congress shall have power to regulate the remedies available in such suits, including limitations on damages, prospective relief, and procedural requirements.</p>

        <p><strong>Section 4.</strong> No doctrine of sovereign immunity, whether derived from common law, constitutional interpretation, or judicial construction, shall bar jurisdiction otherwise granted by this Constitution or by law.</p>

      <p>
        This text is drafted to do four things plainly:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Repeal the Eleventh Amendment.</li>
        <li>Prevent revival of state sovereign immunity through non-textual theories.</li>
        <li>Preserve congressional authority over remedies and procedure.</li>
        <li>Eliminate jurisdictional avoidance where federal law supplies a cause of action.</li>
      </ul>
