      A proposal to restore judicial accountability and end state sovereign immunity as a barrier to federal law.

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Under modern doctrine, States of the United States may violate federal law and yet avoid accountability
        in federal court by invoking sovereign immunity. This immunity is not limited to damages, but frequently
        prevents courts from reaching the merits of serious constitutional and statutory claims.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is a system in which legality is acknowledged but unenforceable, and where courts routinely
        dismiss cases not because the law favors the government, but because the defendant is deemed untouchable.
      </p>

      <h2>What the Eleventh Amendment Does Today</h2>
      <p>
        Although adopted in 1795 as a narrow response to a specific jurisdictional controversy, the Eleventh
        Amendment has been transformed by judicial interpretation into a broad doctrine of state sovereign
        immunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, it operates as a categorical shield for states against suit in federal court, even where Congress
        has created a cause of action, and even where constitutional violations are ongoing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why Repeal Is Necessary</h2>
      <p>
        No person, corporation, municipality, or federal official enjoys immunity from suit simply by virtue of
        status. States alone occupy this position.
      </p>
      <p>
        This asymmetry undermines the rule of law. It forces courts into doctrinal evasions, encourages legal
        fictions, and leaves individuals without a forum to vindicate federal rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Repeal would not expand judicial power beyond its proper bounds. It would restore courts to their core
        function: deciding the legality of government action when properly presented.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>What Repeal Does Not Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It does not abolish federalism.</li>
        <li>It does not require damages in every case.</li>
        <li>It does not prevent Congress from limiting remedies.</li>
        <li>It does not place courts in charge of state policy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Repeal removes a jurisdictional barrier. It does not dictate outcomes.

      <h2>Proposed Amendment</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Section 1.</strong> The Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed.</p>
        <p><strong>Section 2.</strong> Neither the United States nor any State shall be immune, by reason of sovereignty,
        from suit in any court of the United States arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States,
        or treaties made under their authority.</p>
        <p><strong>Section 3.</strong> Congress shall have power to regulate the remedies available in such suits,
        including limitations on damages, prospective relief, and procedural requirements.</p>
        <p><strong>Section 4.</strong> No doctrine of sovereign immunity, whether derived from common law,
        constitutional interpretation, or judicial construction, shall bar jurisdiction otherwise granted by
        this Constitution or by law.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        This site exists to articulate a clear constitutional argument: that state sovereign immunity, as enforced
        through the Eleventh Amendment, is incompatible with modern federal law and democratic accountability.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project is non-partisan, informational, and intended for public discussion. All text is offered for
        reuse, citation, and critique.
